# Dragon's Mist Council

The monthly council meeting is where the business of the SCA is done for each branch.
In the barony of Dragon's Mist, council is held on the 3rd Thursday of the month at
the Round Table Pizza on Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy in Beaverton.

### What exactly is a council meeting?

Each branch of the SCA hold regular meetings to coordinate the business side of the organization.
We have budgets to check, proposals to discuss, events to plan, and a lot more. It all is covered
at our council meetings.

### When and Where is the meeting?

The meeting is every third Thursday of the month. We meet at 7:00pm at the Round Table Pizza in
Beaverton off Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway. The room is available starting at 6:30pm so feel free 
come early to get a bite to eat while you meet the other members of the barony.
